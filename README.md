# ShorelineandVolumetricChangeAnalysis
PyShoreVolume

A Python Package for semi automated object orientated shoreline change and beach volumetric change analysis. This package offers the ability to perform 5 Shoreline Change Analysis functions (EPR, NSM, SCE, Erosion and Accretion and Linear Regression Rate) from transect based shoreline intersection shapefiles. The functions produce a full set of associated statistics for each transect in the form of a Pandas DataFrame graphical output along with a graphical production of shorleine change distances per transect. This package also offers a series of functions to perform volumetric change analysis from a time series of Digital Elevation Models, producing graphical outputs and volumetric statistics per function.
